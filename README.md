# 100 Days of Coding Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Coding Challenge** repository! üéâ

## About the Challenge

This repository is where I document my journey through 100 days of coding. Each day, I tackle new coding challenges or solve problems that have been on my mind, exploring different languages and technologies as I go. My goal is to strengthen my skills, gain exposure to various coding tools, and ultimately become a more versatile and experienced developer.

## What You‚Äôll Find

- **Daily Code Solutions:** Every day, I post a new code snippet, mini-project, or solution to a problem.
- **Random Language Selection:** I code in whatever language or framework I‚Äôm in the mood for that day. This could include:
  - Python üêç
  - Java ‚òï
  - JavaScript ‚ö°
  - Rust ü¶Ä
  - C++
  - And many more!
- **Learning in the Open:** I'm constantly learning and improving. This challenge isn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit's about growth, experimentation, and exposure.

## Structure of the Repository

- `Day_01/` - Each day will have its own folder containing the code I worked on and a brief explanation of the challenge.
- `Day_02/` - And so on for each day.
  
Each folder contains:
  - The code file(s) in the language used for that day.

## Motivation

I often get random urges to code based on something I find interesting or irksome in my daily life. Whether it's improving a script, learning a new technology, or building a small project‚Äîthis challenge allows me to turn those moments of curiosity into learning experiences. It‚Äôs also an excellent way to stay consistent and track my progress over time.

## Goals

- **Consistency:** Coding every day, no matter how small the contribution.
- **Exposure:** Learning new languages, tools, and frameworks.
- **Problem-Solving:** Tackling random problems that I want to solve with code.
- **Sharing Knowledge:** Keeping my work public so others can learn from my experiments and mistakes.
